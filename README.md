# team-profile-generator
A program that generates profiles for four of your co-workers
# How to use
Users should download the following to use this program:
Jest
Inquirer
FS
RX
All of which can be found with npm.
# Problems
So... there's no node_modules folder. I have no idea why. Some people also had this issue but it seems to be a mac problem. Except I'm on Windows. Maybe Windows 11 is responsible,
but at least the program still functions.
# Demonstration
Below is a video demonstrating the app's functionality
